/* If the c++20 variable `openBrace` can be '{' or 'st{', what is the most efficient way to check? For example regular expressions vs if-statements.

In general, regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching, but they can also be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with complex patterns or large amounts of text. In this case, since we only need to check for two possible values of the variable openBrace, using an if-statement would likely be the most efficient approach.

Here's an example of how you could check the value of openBrace using an if-statement:

cpp */

if (openBrace == '{' || openBrace == "st{") {
  // do something
}

/* This approach simply checks if the value of openBrace is equal to either '{' or "st{", and performs some action if it is. Since there are only two possible values to check for, the if-statement should be relatively efficient.

However, if you need to perform more complex pattern matching or need to handle a larger number of possible values, regular expressions may be a better choice. In general, the choice between using an if-statement or a regular expression depends on the specific requirements of your use case.

Would a hash using openBrace as a hash key be more efficient?

Using a hash table with openBrace as a key could potentially be more efficient than using an if-statement or a regular expression, especially if you need to perform this check many times with a large number of possible values.

Here's an example of how you could use a hash table to check the value of openBrace:

cpp */

#include <unordered_set>

std::unordered_set<std::string> braceSet{"{", "st{"};

if (braceSet.count(openBrace)) {
  // do something
}

/* This approach creates an unordered set called braceSet containing the two possible values of openBrace. 
It then checks if openBrace is in the set using the count method, which returns 1 if the element is present and 0 otherwise.

Using a hash table can be more efficient than an if-statement or regular expression if you have a large number of possible values to check for, 
as the lookup time for an unordered set is typically constant on average. However, if you only have a small number of possible values to check for, 
the overhead of creating and maintaining a hash table may outweigh the potential performance benefits. In that case, 
an if-statement or regular expression would likely be more efficient. */
